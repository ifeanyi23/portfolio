                    <h1>Hi thanks for visiting my site</h1>
                    <p>I began my journey in Web Development some year ago, and while taking up courses and never really learnt how to create an efficient website
                        I had to look for projects to take on. When i took up the projects, initially they seem difficult but after spending sometime on it and trying
                        different things, I got it right.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now I am an experience Web Developer as I have worked on several projects which could be found on my portfolio. I am looking foward to working with clients to ensuring
                        that what they ask for is what they get. I have ensured that during the Development stage of the project, daily feedback would be given to the client so as to
                        ensure quality project delivered.
                    </p>
